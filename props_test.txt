Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in folding of the protein into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.\nA linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than about 20-30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code.", "name./freebase/linguistic_hint/subject_form": "Proteins", "identifier./food/nutrient/usda_id": "203", "object./type/object/timestamp": "2006-10-22T09:17:32.0030Z", "name./common/topic/alias": "Protein in nutrition"},

It is a sterol, a lipid molecule and is biosynthesized by all animal cells because it is an essential structural component of animal cell membranes that is required to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. Cholesterol enables animal cells to not need a cell wall to protect membrane integrity/cell-viability and thus be able to change shape and move about.\nIn addition to its importance within cells, cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D. Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by animals. All kinds of cells in animals can produce it. In vertebrates the hepatic cells typically produce greater amounts than other cells. It is almost completely absent among prokaryotes, although there are some exceptions such as Mycoplasma, which require cholesterol for growth.\nFran\u00e7ois Poulletier de la Salle first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1769.

Because of its lower boiling point, the freebase form of heroin is also smokable. It is prevalent in heroin coming from Afghanistan, which in 2004 produced roughly 87% of the world supply in illicit raw opium. However, the production rate in Mexico has risen sixfold from 2007 to 2011, changing that percentage and placing Mexico as the second largest opium producer in the world.\nAs with other opioids, diacetylmorphine is used as both an analgesic and a recreational drug.

L-Valine is one of 20 proteinogenic amino acids. Its codons are GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG. This essential amino acid is classified as nonpolar. Human dietary sources are any proteinaceous foods such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes.\nAlong with leucine and isoleucine, valine is a branched-chain amino acid. It is named after the plant valerian. In sickle-cell disease, valine substitutes for the hydrophilic amino acid glutamic acid in hemoglobin. Because valine is hydrophobic, the hemoglobin is prone to abnormal aggregation.", "url./common/topic/topical_webpage": "http://www.hmdb.ca/scripts/show_card.cgi?METABOCARD=HMDB00883.txt", "identifier./chemistry/chemical_compound/pubchem_id": "1182", "name./chemistry/chemical_compound/formula": "C5H11NO2", "measurement./chemistry/chemical_compound/melting_point": "298.0", "name./biology/amino_acid/three_letter_abbreviation": "Val", "measurement./chemistry/chemical_compound/average_molar_mass": "117.151", "name./chemistry/chemical_compound/iuapc_id": "Valine", "name./common/topic/alias": "VAL_G", "identifier./chemistry/chemical_compound/structure_smiles": "CC(C)C(C(=O)O)N"},

It is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most electronegative element, it is extremely reactive: almost all other elements, including some noble gases, form compounds with fluorine.\nAmong the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in universal abundance and 13th in terrestrial abundance. Fluorite, the primary mineral source of fluorine, was first described in 1529; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb fluo meaning \"flow\" became associated with it. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, a process still employed for modern production. Industrial synthesis of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest application, began during the Manhattan Project in World War II.", "measurement./chemistry/chemical_element/boiling_point": "-188.15", "name./chemistry/chemical_element/symbol": "F", "url./common/topic/topical_webpage": "http://www.hmdb.ca/scripts/show_card.cgi?METABOCARD=HMDB00662.txt", "identifier./chemistry/chemical_compound/pubchem_id": "5360525", "measurement./chemistry/chemical_element/covalent_radius": "64.0", "measurement./chemistry/chemical_element/ionization_energy": "17.4228", "measurement./chemistry/chemical_element/atomic_number": "9", "measurement./chemistry/chemical_element/van_der_waals_radius": "150.0", "measurement./chemistry/chemical_element/atomic_mass": "18.9984032", "measurement./chemistry/chemical_element/electronegativity": "3.98", "name./common/topic/alias": "Fluorures acide"},
"/m/04tc_": {"description./common/topic/description": "A mineral is a naturally occurring substance that is solid and inorganic representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and has an ordered atomic structure. It is different from a rock, which can be an aggregate of minerals or non-minerals and does not have a specific chemical composition. The exact definition of a mineral is under debate, especially with respect to the requirement a valid species be abiogenic, and to a lesser extent with regard to it having an ordered atomic structure. The study of minerals is called mineralogy.\nThere are over 4,900 known mineral species; over 4,660 of these have been approved by the International Mineralogical Association. The silicate minerals compose over 90% of the Earth's crust. The diversity and abundance of mineral species is controlled by the Earth's chemistry. Silicon and oxygen constitute approximately 75% of the Earth's crust, which translates directly into the predominance of silicate minerals. Minerals are distinguished by various chemical and physical properties.", "name./common/topic/alias": "Rock", "name./freebase/linguistic_hint/subject_form": "Minerals", "object./type/object/timestamp": "2006-10-22T09:11:37.0060Z"}
